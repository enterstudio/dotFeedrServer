# wodCZ/dotFeedrServer

Tiny weekend-project, inspired by http://agar.io/.

It's html5 absorb-game based on EaselJS framework.

This is Server side, it runs on socket.io.

Client-side is located at https://github.com/wodCZ/dotFeedr

## Todo
 - tweak bubble-bubble collision to happen more intuitively
 - code-cleanup
 - integrate client

## Extra Todo (features over agar.io)
 - ability to create account & sign in
 - add "coins"
 - ability to upgrade modifiers for those coins


## Disclaimer 

I'm PHP programmer, so code absolutely doesn't follow JS best-practices. I didn't want to build it beatifully clean from scratch, rather learn while coding. 
Also, first commit messages are not great. I usually don't do this...
